    "- **Every notebook assignment has an accompanying quiz**. Your work in each notebook assignment will serve as the basis for your quiz answers.\n",
    "- **You can consult any resources you want when completing these exercises and problems**. Just as it is in the \"real world:\" if you can't figure out how to do something, look it up. My recommendation is that you check the relevant parts of the assigned reading or search for inspiration on [https://stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com).\n",
    "- **Each problem is worth 1 point**. All problems are equally weighted.\n",
    "- **The information you need for each problem set is provided in the blue and green cells.** General instructions / the problem set preamble are in the blue cells, and instructions for specific problems are in the green cells. **You have to execute all of the code in the problem set, but you are only responsible for entering code into the code cells that immediately follow a green cell**. You will also recognize those cells because they will be incomplete. You need to replace each blank `▰▰#▰▰` with the code that will make the cell execute properly (where # is a sequentially-increasing integer, one for each blank).\n",
    "- Most modules will contain at least one question that requires you to load data from disk; **it is up to you to locate the data, place it in an appropriate directory on your local machine, and replace any instances of the `PATH_TO_DATA` variable with a path to the directory containing the relevant data**.\n",
    "- **The comments in the problem cells contain clues indicating what the following line of code is supposed to do.** Use these comments as a guide when filling in the blanks. \n",
    "- **You can ask for help**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, remember that you do not need to \"master\" this content before moving on to other course materials, as what is introduced here is reinforced throughout the rest of the course. You will have plenty of time to practice and cement your new knowledge and skills.\n",
    "<div class='alert alert-block alert-danger'>As you complete this assignment, you may encounter variables that can be assigned a wide variety of different names. Rather than forcing you to employ a particular convention, we leave the naming of these variables up to you. During the quiz, submit an answer of 'USER_DEFINED' (without the quotation marks) to fill in any blank that you assigned an arbitrary name to. In most circumstances, this will occur due to the presence of a local iterator in a for-loop.</b></div>"
