Just as it is in the \"real world:\" if you can't figure out how to do something, look it up. My recommendation is that you check the relevant parts of the assigned reading or search for inspiration on [https://stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com).\n","- **Each problem is worth 1 point**. All problems are equally weighted.\n","- **The information you need for each problem set is provided in the blue and green cells.** General instructions / the problem set preamble are in the blue cells, and instructions for specific problems are in the green cells. **You have to execute all of the code in the problem set, but you are only responsible for entering code into the code cells that immediately follow a green cell**. You will also recognize those cells because they will be incomplete. You need to replace each blank `▰▰#▰▰` with the code that will make the cell execute properly (where # is a sequentially-increasing integer, one for each blank).\n","- Most modules will contain at least one question that requires you to load data from disk; **it is up to you to locate the data, place it in an appropriate directory on your local machine, and replace any instances of the `PATH_TO_DATA` variable with a path to the directory containing the relevant data**.\n","- **The comments in the problem cells contain clues indicating what the following line of code is supposed to do.** Use these comments as a guide when filling in the blanks. \n","- **You can ask for help**. \n","\n","Finally, remember that you do not need to \"master\" this content before moving on to other course materials, as what is introduced here is reinforced throughout the rest of the course.
